# Dice_App
This App Is A Very Simple And Basic App In Which After Installing The App User Can Click On Any Of The Dice To Change Both The Dice Faces At The Same Time.

In this firts we will create the scaffold of our app.
After that we will create a stateful widget.
In the stateful widget first we will initialize two integer variables and also define a function with random widget.
In the widget part of our stateful widget we will create a centered row in which we will place our two dice faces.
For both the dices we will use flat button class and within that we will call our pre defined function.
After that on every click(on any dice) both the dice face will change at the same time
